    "\n",
    "    ii) string is the data which can be used as input and produced as output by the program.\n",

    "       \n",

    "         Variables are not indexed they behaved as reference for the memory location.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iv)  string characters are immutable as we can't change their characters with other characters.\n",
    "         Variables values can be changed as many times as program needs.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     v) Examples of string are as: 'hello',\"34jljj34357\",'434','@#*erlj\" etc.\n",

    "ii) list - list is the collection of data and data can be of any available data type of python.List is unordered and indexed data collection.List is mutable data type. Ex- [343,[343,\"dhs\"],{\"sdk\",4+5j},\"mango\",(34,\"fdljk\"),34.34]\n",
